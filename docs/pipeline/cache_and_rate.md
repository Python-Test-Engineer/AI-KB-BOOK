# User ratings

Once a user gets a final response, the user will have the option to rate the response. 

We will record if they give it a thumbs up or down and they can also add thier own comments/additions to the response.

These are all saved in the database so that later when another user asks a question we can check if a similar one with a positive rating exists. This can be fouind very quickly and offered to the user with the option of requesting further information.

In time a large dataset of question/answer pairs can be created and then used to fine tune a model to make better predictions.

Further more, by storing the data in an atomic fashion, organisations can import and export datasets easily.

A human researcher may develop their own dataset/FAQs and these can be shared amongsts organisations.
