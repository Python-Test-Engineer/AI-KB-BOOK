# Ingestion

Once we have our data that has been cleaned and formatted, we need to ingest it into our knowledge base. Ingestion is the process of taking data and converting it into a format that can be used by our knowledge base.

This means creating vector embeddings for each chunk, (which is termed a Document and many Documents make a paper/pdf) and then indexing them into a vector database.
