# About

This is a work in progress where I collect resources and ideas concerning AI Search, RAG and Agentic AI.

## AI Search

Using both Semantic and Traditonal search, a Hybrid search system can yield the best document retrieval for RAG implementations.

## RAG

Retrieval Augmented Generation enables us to add domain specific data to our our prompts for better answers.

## Agentic AI

The use of AI Agents where agents can plan, retrieve, refine and generate answers and reports is often called Agentic RAG.

## AI Agents in the Data Pipeline

The use of AI Agents in the Data Pipeline from ETL, Analysis to Reporting enables us to generate reports from data sources.
