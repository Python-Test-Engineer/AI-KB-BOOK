Humans set goals, but an AI agent independently chooses the best actions it needs to perform to achieve those goals. For example, consider a contact center AI agent that wants to resolves customer queries. The agent will automatically ask the customer different questions, look up information in internal documents, and respond with a solution. Based on the customer responses, it determines if it can resolve the query itself or pass it on to a human.</p> <p>Whilst we may have our overall flowchart, the AI Agent will determine the path to take. It is like having the roll of a dice determine the next step. We have a predetermined set of tasks, but the agent will determine the best way to complete those tasks.</p>"},{"location":"#naive_rag","title":"Naive Rag","text":"<p>Two years ago when we first looked at RAG, the strategy was to take a document and split into chuncks of say 500 characters and have an overlap of 100 charactes with the next chunk to maintain some context.</p> <p>This works very well for single modality text documents where this Niave Rag is in effect a search tool, taking an unstructured query and using LLMs and semantic search to find relevant chunks and answer the question.</p>"},{"location":"#changes_in_2yrs","title":"Changes in 2yrs","text":"<p>In the past two years there have been many changes in the space.</p> <ul> <li>Context windows, the amount of text we can pass to the LLM has grown from 4K to 32K+</li> <li>Compute power has greatly increased, costs have gone donw by 90%.</li> <li>LLMs have become bigger and better, with many specialist LLMs that are fine tuned for particular uses.</li> <li>LLMs can now understand images, tables and videos better, with LLMs that can parse different media and convert them into text.</li> <li>Many frameworks and services for RAG have emerged and 2025 is thought of the year that the question will be which system to use?</li> <li>Naive Rag has been replaced with more sophisticated strategies that involve all aspects of the architecture:</li> </ul> <p>Without needing to understand this next image, here is the current 'state of the art' RAG architecture:</p> <p></p> <p>New academic papers for better techniques are continually being published.</p> <p>\"This is the worst it will ever be...\" - someone said.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"craig/contact/","title":"Contact me","text":"<p>Email: iwswordpress@gmail.com</p> <p>LinkedIn: Craig West</p>"},{"location":"craig/courses/","title":"Online courses","text":""},{"location":"craig/courses/#udemycom","title":"Udemy.com","text":"<p>The course Udemy Hooks and Plugins course has just been published and Udemy has a sale ever two weeks and the cost would be $20 USD approx.</p> <p></p> <p>I am currently developing two courses:</p> <ul> <li>Python - mock, patch and monkeypatch.</li> <li>PyTest Django Full Stack - a DB &lt;-&gt;
